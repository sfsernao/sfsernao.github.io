<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>CHIRP (Collective for Holistic Interdisciplinary Research in Photonics) is a research group dedicated to the study and development of advanced technologies in photonics, integrating interdisciplinary and holistic approaches. Beyond its research work, CHIRP is a formative and collaborative space where students can strengthen their passion for science, share innovative ideas and actively participate in projects that generate real impact. By joining CHIRP, members have the opportunity to grow academically and professionally in an environment that fosters creativity, teamwork and critical thinking. </p>

<p>This is were we will populate biographies and images of current and past members. I will need to research and edit how to implement a sub page so to speak inside this page acting as a link, where we will have a brief overview such as what appears in the paragraph above. This will be a link or tab of sorts to open a biography section with images and additional text information of members biographies, names, major, project, etc.</p>
